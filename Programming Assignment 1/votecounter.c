/**Function : parseInput
 * Arguments: 'filename' - name of the input file
 * 			  'n' - Pointer to Nodes to be allocated by parsing
 * Output: Number of Total Allocated Nodes
 * About parseInput: parseInput is supposed to
 * 1) Open the Input File [There is a utility function provided in utility handbook]
 * 2) Read it line by line : Ignore the empty lines [There is a utility function provided in utility handbook]
 * 3) Call parseInputLine(..) on each one of these lines
 ..After all lines are parsed(and the DAG created)
 4) Assign node->"prog" ie, the commands that each of the nodes has to execute
 For Leaf Nodes: ./leafcounter <arguments> is the command to be executed.
 Please refer to the utility handbook for more details.
 For Non-Leaf Nodes, that are not the root node(ie, the node which declares the winner):
 ./aggregate_votes <arguments> is the application to be executed. [Refer utility handbook]
 For the Node which declares the winner:
 This gets run only once, after all other nodes are done executing
 It uses: ./find_winner <arguments> [Refer utility handbook]

/**Function : parseInputLine
 * Arguments: 's' - Line to be parsed
 * 			  'n' - Pointer to Nodes to be allocated by parsing
 * Output: Number of Region Nodes allocated
 * About parseInputLine: parseInputLine is supposed to
 * 1) Split the Input file [Hint: Use makeargv(..)]
 * 2) Recognize the line containing information of
 * candidates(You can assume this will always be the first line containing data).
 * You may want to store the candidate's information
 * 3) Recognize the line containing "All Nodes"
 * (You can assume this will always be the second line containing data)
 * 4) All the other lines containing data, will show how to connect the nodes together
 * You can choose to do this by having a pointer to other nodes, or in a list etc-

 * Arguments: 'n' - Pointer to Nodes to be allocated by parsing

 * Please note that processes which are independent of each other
 * can and should be running in a parallel fashion
